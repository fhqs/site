FHQS - Anti-social networking site
----------------------------------

You want to contribute to an open-source anti-social network site?
Then feel free to join FHQS and help us.  These are the rules:

1. Improve the design
2. It's anti-social network so try to screw the users over
3. You can use a MongoDB database called "nufx".  Your software should be able to start from an empty database
